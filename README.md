## Dark Mode:

The app uses CSS variables to switch between light and dark themes.
The selected theme is saved in localStorage so it persists across sessions.

---

## How It Works

. Tasks are stored in localStorage for persistenc

. Task filtering and progress bar update dynamically

. Confirmation overlays prevent accidental deletion or update

. Toast notifications provide user feedback

## ⚙️ Installation / Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmednabil22224/ToDo-app.git
````

2. Navigate into the project folder:
   cd todo-app

3.⚠️ Important:

This app uses JavaScript features like localStorage and URL hash routing.
It will not work correctly if opened directly from the file system (e.g., by double-clicking index.html).

You must run it through a local development server.

4.Start a local server:

. If you have VS Code, use the Live Server extension and click “Go Live”.

. Or, use one of these commands from the project folder:

      # Option 1: Using Python (built-in server)
      python -m http.server 5500

      # Option 2: Using Node.js
      npx serve

5.Open in browser:
http://localhost:5500
